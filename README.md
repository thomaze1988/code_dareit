Exercise
In quint there are a lot of tasks that are schedule and can be kicked of manually.
In this exercise I would like you to make a script (in symfony or plain vanilla PHP) that will
 get a file of a FTP server,
 counts the lines in the file.
 Outputs the result (to file or screen)
 Moves the procced file to a backup folder.
The main goal of this exercise is to make a rock solid process for getting and parsing the file.
This will probably not be the hardest code to write but I would like the code to show me you got
insight in the problems that might occur running these kind of processes. (Hint : the process can run
multiple times at once)
